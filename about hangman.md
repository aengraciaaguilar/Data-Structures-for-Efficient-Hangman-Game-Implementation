# Data-Structures-for-Efficient-Hangman-Game-Implementation

The implementation of sorting algorithms, such as Quick Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Insertion Sort, in the Hangman game served to enhance its performance and efficiency. The sorting of the list of words facilitated the player's ability to guess the word, thus elevating the level of challenge and enjoyment in the game. This integration of sorting algorithms into the Hangman game showcases the practical utilization of data structures and algorithms in real-world applications, as well as underscores the significance of sorting algorithms in the field of programming.
